Makefile should build perfectly. **Run ./a.out**

Compiles and runs on linux, problems with MacOS unix. Window dimensions modified to match any device it's being used on.

## Download: 
git clone https://github.com/THEZJLin/f.git

## How to play: 

Building your civilization, two gods fight to control the board. Starting at oposite corners, after each turn, each civilization grows by itself. When your population dies, you gain souls which can be used to make actions that can influence the growth in your population on the board or the decrease of the other player's population. Fighting for board control, the win condition is to conquer the whole board.

Basic and controls:
* Arrow keys control movement across board.
* Enter key takes selection, prompted by action menu.

## What will be implemented in the near future (if we end up pursuing this game further)
* Tutorial: Would be nice to implement a tutorial to make playing a little easier.
* Balancing and patching: Player in top left expands faster than the player in the bottom right just because of the base iterators used in the population growth.
* More than two player game: Would be cool to implement up to 4 or 8 player system.
